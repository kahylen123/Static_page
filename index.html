      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Kahylen Minniefield and this is my first web page. I'm currently a senior in college and if everything goes well I should be graduating in a few weeks! I plan on finishing with a degree in Biology with a minor in Mathmatics, Computer Science and Chemistry from the University of North Texas. My current plan is to further my schooling and get a graduate degree in some sort of biological research. I am still trying to figure out if I would like to focus more on a genetics baseline with some connection to the biocomputing side of the research or the inverse where I would focus mainly on the biocomputing portion of the research and work with other biologists. To help with the decision I want to apply to work with an acedemic research labs as an assistant to get real experience in the field and know what I enjoy in the field while also getting a cut in the tuition costs.</p>

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>I enjoy most things fantasy whether it be with books, video games or movies. I would say most big names in the genre I have at least heard about and have at least a passing knowlege of. The smaller lesser known ones I might be ingnorant of but I will likely still be interested and willing to dive in the titles. When it comes to general internet things I enjoy youtube and reddit. I enjoy most gaming and general "nerd" content but I enjoy lots of biology related topics as well. If you ever would want to come into contact with me feel free to look below for a link to some of my socials and an email address!   </p>
